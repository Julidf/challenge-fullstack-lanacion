### Frontend Initialization

2. Navigate to the frontend directory.
3. Install the dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Start the frontend server using `npm run dev`.
5. This will start the frontend application on the port 5173.

### Backend Initialization

2. Navigate to the backend directory.
3. Install the dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Start the backend server using `npm start`.
5. This will start the backend application on the port 8000.

### Docker Initialization

If you prefer to get started with the app using Docker:

2. Ensure Docker is installed on your machine.
3. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
4. Build the Docker images using:
   ```bash
